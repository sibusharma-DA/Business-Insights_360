📊 BI 360 Dashboard

📌 Situation:
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing global electronics brand, was struggling to make data-driven decisions. Departments like Sales, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain worked in silos with outdated Excel reports. This led to poor forecasting, unprofitable campaigns, inventory issues, and even financial losses—especially after an expansion based on gut instinct rather than data.

🎯 Task:
Build a centralized Power BI dashboard that brings together key business insights across departments. The dashboard should help stakeholders make informed decisions, identify trends, and monitor performance in real time.

⚙️ Action:

Collected and cleaned raw data from a MySQL database and Excel sheets.

Built a strong data model using star schema principles and best practices.

Created interactive Power BI dashboards for different functions (Sales, Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive view).

Used advanced DAX measures, KPIs, slicers, bookmarks, and drill-through filters for a smooth user experience.

Published the report to Power BI Service with auto-refresh and role-based access.

✅ Result:

The company now has a single source of truth for business performance.

Enabled each department to monitor their KPIs and take timely action.

Helped executives make strategic decisions with confidence.

Improved operational efficiency, campaign ROI, stock planning, and profit margins.
